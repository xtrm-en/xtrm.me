# so what then?

*A lot of things actually...*

This is a work in progress, and I'm not sure how much time I'll be able to put into it. But here's a list of things I'd like to do.

## To actually do

- [ ] `/404` page
- [x] posts layout
- [ ] `/posts/` page
- [ ] `/projects/` page
- [ ] `/links/` (which would double as a `/contact/`) page
- [x] markdown prismjs integration for codeblocks !!!!!
- [ ] `/about/` page? or maybe keep that to the main page
- [ ] Posts tag management
- [ ] Posts pagination
- [ ] Posts search
- [ ] actually use data instead of hardcoding shit

## may be nice
- [ ] `/resume/` page
- [ ] Posts RSS?
- [ ] Posts comments? (maybe via mastodon)
