# hi :wave:, I'm **killian.**

welcome to my new *new* *new* website, this time using a static site generator! we'll see how that goes...

this is heavily under development but I think I plan on moving everything here, my socials, my projects, etc.  
i also plan on writing quite a bit of posts and use this as a blog, stay fucking tuned guys!!!!

i'll update this homepage once everything is set in place and *approximately* working as intended :+1:

also also also is the header title noticably a link to the homepage? like do i *need* to add a "home" navbar item?? genuinely wondering because even I can't tell sometimes

anyways here's the [TODO list](./TODO.mdx) if you're interested.  
here is the [mdx renderer tests page](./render-tests.mdx).  
here's a WIP [writeup article](/posts/push-swap.mdx) about a school project I did, `push_swap`.  
here's two [test](/posts/my-first-post.mdx) [posts](/posts/my-second-post.mdx) (for whenever i finish the layout)
