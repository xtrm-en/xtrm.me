# welcome to my space :wave:, i'm **X**. 

welcome to my new *new* *new* website, this time using a :fire: [static site generator](https://lume.land)! and this time, with the intent to keep it alive haha- we'll see how that goes...

there's still so much to do and so many things I'm not 100% perfectly happy with, but who cares!!! I'll work on the website from time to time and refactor/redesign some stuff until I can no longer complain about myself (extreme challenge).

i'll update this homepage once everything is set in place and *approximately* working as intended :+1: like y'know having a cool intro **hero** section and proper *"here's a bit about myself but not too much"* section
