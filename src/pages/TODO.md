# so what then?

*A lot of things actually...*

This is (also) a work in progress, and I'm not sure how much time I'll be able to put into it. But here's a list of things I'd like to do.

## To actually do

- [x] `/404.html` page
- [x] posts layout
- [x] `/posts/` page
- [ ] `/projects/` page
- [x] `/links/` (which would double as a `/contact/`) page
- [x] prismjs integration for codeblocks
  - [ ] maybe switch to Shikiji?
- [ ] improve rendering for some elements:
  - [ ] tables
  - [x] blockquotes
- [x] `/about/` page
- [ ] Posts tag management
  - [x] Posts can have tags
  - [ ] There are tag-specific listing pages
  - [ ] You can search for tags
- [x] Posts pagination
- [ ] Posts search
- [ ] actually use data instead of hardcoding stuff
- [x] better Lume/Rehype configs
- [ ] LumeCMS
- [ ] update main page when everything's kinda done-ish

## may be nice
- [ ] `/resume/` page
- [x] Posts RSS? `/feed.json` & `/feed.xml`
- [ ] Posts comments? (maybe via mastodon)
